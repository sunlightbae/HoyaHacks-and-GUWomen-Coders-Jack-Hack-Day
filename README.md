# Serve DC

Serve DC is a small community app built around a simple idea:  
**neighbors helping neighbors.**

It’s a pseudo-anonymous space where people in DC can post when they need help, want to share resources, or need to alert others about something important nearby.

## What You Can Do

- Post requests for urgent help, safety alerts, giveaways, or general announcements  
- Posts are automatically categorized to keep things organized  
- Optionally add a location to show a small map (never required)  
- Reply to posts in threads to coordinate help  
- See which posts are new so nothing important gets missed  

The goal is to make asking for help feel easy, safe, and human.

## Accessibility & Safety

Serve DC was designed with accessibility and trust in mind:
- Plain language and simple categories
- Optional location sharing for privacy
- Pseudo-anonymous posting to lower the barrier for people who may feel uncomfortable asking for help publicly
